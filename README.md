# 232Algorithms

This lab implements three different algorithms:

1. Prim's Algorithm
  Start at the vertex put the value in the minimum spanning tree. Find all edges from the newest vertex to other vertices that 
  arent't in the tree. Add edges to the priority queue. Pick the edge with the longest length.
  
 2. Kruskal's Algorithm
  Find the smallest nuber of edges anywhere and add it as long as it doesn't create a cycle.
  
  
 3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
    Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph by finding the shortest paths among all pairs of vertices.
